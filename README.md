# Velocity-Tracker
My process in creating a velocity tracker for weightlifting / powerlifting that I can use to track the velocity of my lifts
Current Ideas:
1) figure out a way to get a camera feed for each rep that I do and save it in google drive with a link to it in google sheets
2) Get the Serial data to read out from the velocity tracker and record all data
   a) ROM
   b) Velocity
   c) Acceleration
   c 2) Point of highest acceleration
   d) Power?
3) Create some kind of program or website to maniuplate the other settings that go into it
4)
