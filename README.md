# Velocity-Tracker
My process in creating a velocity tracker for weightlifting / powerlifting that I can use to track the velocity of my lifts
Current Ideas:
1) figure out a way to get a camera feed for each rep that I do and save it in google drive with a link to it in google sheets
2) Get the Serial data to read out from the velocity tracker and record all data
   a) ROM
   b) Velocity
   c) Acceleration
   c 2) Point of highest acceleration
   d) Power?
3) Create some kind of program or website to maniuplate the other settings that go into it
4) Creat a PCB that can hold all of the eletrical componeents for the top of the device
5) Create different modes that you can set the device too
   a) Full data mode where it uploads everything to google sheets
   b) just asks for number of reps and spits out that data
   c) super simple mode where it just gives you last velocity
   d) find ROM / DEPTH mode
   e) some kind of data discovery mode
